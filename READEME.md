Following [nluqo](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/) tutorial to create a broughlike game in javascript.
The idea behind the tutorial is to get a feeling of javascript without importing modules so that version control is easy (no dependency and only browser compatibility is something to look at), and the code is one's own through and through.

I added some functionality that I found necessary, such as touch controls so I can play with it on my phone.
